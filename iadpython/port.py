Implementation of container class for an integrating sphere port.

This module defines the Port class, which is integral to the analysis of light properties
within an integrating sphere. The Port class specifically models a port on the sphere's
surface, calculating and storing its geometrical properties and its interaction with light.

Classes:
    Port: Represents a port in an integrating sphere. It holds information about
    the port's dimensions, position, and optical properties. The class provides
    methods to calculate the port's geometrical characteristics, such as the
    area of the spherical cap it forms, its sagitta, and the chord distance from
    the port's center to its edge. Additionally, it includes functionality to
    assess whether a given point on the sphere's surface falls within the port's
    boundaries.

Functions:
    - cap_area_exact: Calculates the area of the spherical cap formed by the port.
    - relative_cap_area: Calculates the approximate relative area of the spherical cap.
    - calculate_sagitta: Determines the sagitta (or height) of the spherical cap.
    - max_center_chord: Computes the maximum distance from the port's center to its edge.
    - cap_area_exact: Calculates the exact relative area of the spherical cap.
    - hit: Checks if a point on the sphere falls within the port's boundaries.

Example:
    >>> import iadpython as iad
    >>> sphere = iad.Sphere(200, 20)  # Example of creating a sphere object
    >>> port = Port(sphere, 20, 0.5, 0, 0, 0)
    >>> print(port)

    Generate a point uniformly distributed on a unit disk.

    This function generates and returns a point (x, y) that is uniformly distributed
    over the area of a unit disk centered at the origin (0, 0). The unit disk is
    defined as the set of all points (x, y) such that x^2 + y^2 <= 1. The method
    uses rejection sampling, where random points are generated within the square
    that bounds the unit disk, and only points that fall within the disk are accepted.

        tuple of (float, float, float): A point (x, y) where x and y are the

class Port:

    Container class for a port on an integrating sphere.

    A container class for a port in an integrating sphere, which is a structure
    used to analyze light properties. The class calculates and stores various
    geometrical properties of the port, such as its diameter, position, and the
    relative area of the spherical cap it forms on the sphere's surface.

    Attributes:
        sphere (object): Reference to the sphere the port belongs to.
        d (float): Diameter of the port in millimeters (mm).
        uru (float): Diffuse reflectance of diffuse light on the port.
        x (float): X-coordinate of the port's center on the sphere's surface.
        y (float): Y-coordinate of the port's center on the sphere's surface.
        z (float): Z-coordinate of the port's center on the sphere's surface.
        a (float): Relative area of the port's spherical cap to the sphere's surface.
        chord2 (float): Square of the distance from the port center to the port edge.
        sagitta (float): The sagitta (height) of the spherical cap formed by the port.

    Examples:
