    The criterion is based on an assessment of the (1) round-off error,

    starting thickness depends on the smallest quadrature slab.nu, and
    recommends that when either the infinitesimal generator or diamond
    initialization methods are used then the initial thickness is optimal
    when type 2 and 3 errors are comparable, or when d ≈ µ.

    Note that round-off is important when the starting thickness is less than
    1e-4 for diamond initialization and less than 1e-8 for infinitesimal
    generator initialization assuming about 14 significant digits of accuracy.

    Since the final thickness is determined by repeated doubling, the
    starting thickness is found by dividing by 2 until the starting thickness is
    less than 'mu'.  Also we make checks for a thinnest_layer with zero thickness
