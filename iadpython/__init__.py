"""
Forward and inverse adding-doubling radiative transport calculations.

Extensive documentation is at <https://iadpython.readthedocs.io>

`iadpython` is a pure Python module to do radiative transport calculations
in layered slabs.  The forward calculation and the inverse calculation work
fine as long as integrating spheres are not used.  That code has yet to be
ported to pure python.

An example::

    >>> import iadpython as iad

    >>> mu_s = 10  # scattering coefficient [1/mm]
    >>> mu_a = 0.1 # absorption coefficient [1/mm]
    >>> g = 0.9    # scattering anisotropy
    >>> d = 1      # thickness mm

    >>> a = mu_s/(mu_a+mu_s)
    >>> b = mu_s/(mu_a+mu_s) * d

    >>> # air / glass / sample / glass / air
    >>> s = iadpython.Sample(a=a, b=b, g=g, n=1.4, n_above=1.5, n_below=1.5)
    >>> ur1, ut1, uru, utu = s.rt()

    >>> print('Collimated light incident perpendicular to sample')
    >>> print('  total reflection = %.5f' % ur1)
    >>> print('  total transmission = %.5f' % ut1)

    >>> print('Diffuse light incident on sample')
    >>> print('  total reflection = %.5f' % uru)
    >>> print('  total transmission = %.5f' % utu)
